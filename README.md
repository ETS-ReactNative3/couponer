<strong> You will need a twilio key to create accounts because the current twilio key is bound to my phone number and a mongoDB connection string. All other keys are included for you.</strong>

<strong> Currently there is an issue with the webpack node modules. It runs locally for me fine but will require a bit of googling and installing different webpack versions to compile if you are making a fresh clone. </strong>

You will need a redis server running locally for the server to compile. 

btest@gmail.com to test buisness owner functionality
ctest@gmail.com to test customer functionality
Both passwords are password.

1) cd Couponer
2) npm install
3) cd client
4) npm install
5) cd ..
6) npm run dev
npm run dev will run the client and server at the same time.

Make sure you install the node packages for the server AND the client.
